# CSS Bookshelf
============

## Intro
The books on my shelf, in wonderful CSS3. Learn more about how this was made on the [CSS3 Bookshelf blog post](http://www.steveworkman.com/web-design/css3-web-design/2010/css3-bookshelf/). This is compatible with Safari 4 (OS X 10.6 and iOS), Opera 10.5+, IE10+ Firefox 5+ and Chrome 4+. IE9 works but without animations, and IE 10 works very well.

## Usage
Download the whole repo, make sure you include the bookshelf.css stylesheet and the bookshelf.js file. jQuery 1.4+ is required for the click events

## Demo
Check out the demo in demo.html and see it working on my blog at http://www.steveworkman.com/bookshelf
